### g/t ratings

there are five levels in the g/t (good or trash) system that can be used in any critique:

- ★★★★★ / "GL (God-Level)": Part of the treasures of human civilization with unparallelly high artistic values. Surpassing other similar works in all respects. Extremely pioneering and inspiring for the incoming works. The dedication and effort behind the scene was unimaginably tremendous. Has undergone meticulous polishing and scrutiny and can well stand the test of time. A truly timeless piece of classic.
- ★★★★ / "G (Good)": Overall, it's good. There are obvious mediocrities, but nothing unacceptable. Due to commercial considerations or other limitations (usually the creator's talent/capacity or simply the budget), a certain level of sacrifice was made in terms of artistry.
- ★★★ / "T (Trash)": Mediocre in every way. Nothing stands out and full of apparent shortcomings. A level that most people can achieve by a bit of commitment. Will be quickly forgotten and almost a complete waste of time.
- ★★ / "AT (Absolute Trash)": Ridiculously and hilariously bad. No originality or artistic value of any kind. Has zero contribution to human kind. All creators are completely unprofessional and botched to cover it up. Usually full of plagiarized/poorly crafted elements.
- ★ / "AJ (Absolute Joke)": Seriously disgusting and offensive shit. A threat to the society. Nothing but a pathetic waste of the resources of human civilization and might jeopardize existing works of art. Anybody should avoid at all costs.
- GL and G have three sub-levels: (decent, fair, barely, from high to low).
