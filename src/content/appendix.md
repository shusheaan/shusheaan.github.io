### g/t ratings

there are five levels in the g/t (good or trash) system that can be used in any critique:
 
- ★★★★★ : "GL (God-Level)"
    - Part of the treasures of human civilization with unparallelly peak artistic values.
    - Surpassing other similar works in all respects.
    - Extremely pioneering and inspiring for the incoming works.
    - The dedication and effort behind the scene was unimaginably tremendous, with the best taste of mankind.
    - Has undergone meticulous polishing and scrutiny and can well stand the test of time - a truly eternal masterpiece.
- ★★★★ : "G (Good)"
    - Overall, not bad.
    - Somewhat creative and special. There are obvious mediocrities, but nothing unacceptable.
    - Due to commercial considerations or other limitations, a certain level of sacrifice was made in terms of artistry.
    - Kind of pitiful not pushing to another level. Should have explored/developed more.
    - Might still worth mentioning after years.
- ★★★ : "T (Trash)"
    - Mediocre in every aspect.
    - Nothing stands out and shows lots of apparent shortcomings.
    - Failed to break any expectations.
    - A level that most people can achieve with a bit of commitment.
    - Will be quickly forgotten and can be considered a complete waste of time.
- ★★ : "AT (Absolute Trash)"
    - Hilariously bad.
    - No originality or artistic value of any kind. Has zero contribution to human kind.
    - Creators were completely unprofessional and botched to cover it up.
    - Usually full of plagiarized/poorly crafted elements.
    - A failure in every way. A healthy lifestyle shouldn't contain any of it.
- ★ : "AJ (Absolute Joke)"
    - Seriously disgusting and offensive society-threatening shit.
    - Nothing but a pathetic waste of the resources of human civilization.
    - Might jeopardize existing works of art and have destructive impact on the industry.
    - Anybody should avoid it at all costs.
- due to a high volume, G have three sub-levels: (decent, fair, barely, from high to low).
- empirical distribution:
    - GL (12%)
    - G: decent (26%)  
    - G: fair (21%)  
    - G: barely (16%)  
    - T, AT, and AJ (25%)

### classifications

before you continue, i have to clarify:

- "trash" is not, that, bad - sometimes i kinda like it.
- it's all about making our life better and having fun, don't, get, mad.
- i tried my best to eliminate personal bias and spent lots of hours validating with friends who have proper tastes.
- everything is open to debate/argue - if you disagree and feel very confident, let's discuss.
- many of these have gone through serious debates and are settled by agreements.
