### g/t ratings

5 levels in the g/t (good or trash) system that can be used in any critique:
 
- ★★★★★ : "GL (god-level)"
    - part of the treasures of human civilization with unparallelled peak artistic value.
    - surpassing other similar works in all respects, textbook level work that needs to be studied carefully.
    - extremely pioneering and inspiring for works to come, successfully exploring new possibilities or reaching absolute perfection.
    - the dedication and effort behind the scenes were unimaginably tremendous, reflecting the best taste of humankind.
    - has undergone meticulous polishing and scrutiny and can easily stand the test of time - a truly eternal masterpiece.
- ★★★★ : "G (good)"
    - overall, not bad.
    - somewhat creative and special. there are obvious mediocrities, but nothing unacceptable.
    - due to commercial considerations or other limitations, a certain level of sacrifice was made in terms of artistry.
    - kind of pitiful that it doesn't push to another level. should have explored/developed more.
    - might still worth mentioning after years.
- ★★★ : "T (trash)"
    - mediocre in every way.
    - nothing stands out and shows lots of apparent shortcomings.
    - failed to break any expectations, everything is so boringly predictable.
    - a level that most people can achieve with a bit of commitment.
    - will be quickly forgotten and can be considered a complete waste of time.
- ★★ : "AT (absolute trash)"
    - hilariously bad, what a surprise that the creators didn't just delete it.
    - no originality or artistic value of any kind. has zero contribution to humankind.
    - creators were completely unprofessional and botched their attempts to cover it up.
    - usually full of plagiarized and poorly crafted elements, pure shame.
    - a failure in every way. a healthy lifestyle shouldn't contain any of it.
- ★ : "AJ (absolute joke)"
    - seriously disgusting, offensive, and society-threatening shit.
    - nothing but a pathetic waste of the resources of human civilization.
    - might jeopardize existing works and have destructive impact on the industry and our earth.
    - anybody should avoid it at all costs.
- due to a high volume, G have three sub-levels: (decent, fair, barely, from high to low).
- empirical distribution:
    - GL (12%)
    - G: decent (26%)  
    - G: fair (21%)  
    - G: barely (16%)  
    - T, AT, and AJ (25%)

### classifications

before you continue, i have to clarify:

- "trash" is not, that, bad - sometimes i kinda like it.
- it's all about making our life better and having fun, don't, get, mad.
- i tried my best to eliminate personal bias and spent lots of hours validating with friends who have proper tastes.
- everything is open to debate/argue - if you disagree and feel very confident, let's discuss.
- many of these have gone through serious debates and are settled by agreements.
