## Intro

My research interests include Mathematical Optimization, Statistical Learning, Empirical Asset Pricing, and Portfolio Management. I'm currently working at [J.P. Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/global) as a quant researcher \& developer focusing on model-based portfolio management.

Supervised by [Prof. Leonid Kogan](<https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/leonid-kogan>), I focus on large-scale discrete optimization and ML/AI applications for systematic portfolio construction and trade-gen with tax-smart strategies and risk management.

Before getting into the asset management industry, I received my Master's degree in Financial Mathematics from [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](http://www.mit.edu/), and my Bachelor's degree in Economics from [Jiao Tong University, Shanghai](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I also spent part of my college life at [University of California, Berkeley](<https://www.berkeley.edu/>) and [Stanford University](<https://www.stanford.edu/>) as an exchange student and a certificated research trainee. 

Prior to college, I was a national finalist in Chinese Physics Olympiad (CPhO) and made it top 150 in China, which got me pre-accepted without attending the college entrance examination.
